    "# 📘 Student Card Generator Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction - Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims to develop an application that enables users to generate personalized student cards through a form-based interface. The application provides a preview of the card and allows for exporting it in various formats. Users input details such as Name, First Name, Matricule (student ID), Department, and Photo. The system then creates a structured card design and supports downloading the generated card.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "This application is primarily targeted at educational institutions, students, and administrative staff who need to create and manage student identification cards efficiently. It can be used by individual students for personal generation or by school administrators for bulk processing in advanced implementations.\n",
