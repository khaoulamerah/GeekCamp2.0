    "# 📘 Error Message Explainer Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction - Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is a simple web application designed to explain common C programming error messages for beginners and provide suggested fixes. It allows users to input an error message and receive an explanation, including causes, fixes, and code examples. The app must be built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no backend), and it should work entirely offline without requiring internet access. The second document provides high-level ideas for simple upgrades to enhance the app's professionalism without adding excessive complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "This application is targeted at beginner C programmers, such as students in programming clubs or camps (e.g., Geek Camp / Club Informatique), who encounter common compilation, linker, or runtime errors and need straightforward explanations and guidance to resolve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Features (MVP - Easy Level)\n",
    "These represent the minimum viable product with basic functionality:\n",
    "- Textarea for pasting or typing an error message, with an \"Explain Error\" button and an optional dropdown to select a common error.\n",
    "- Keyword-based, case-insensitive search for matching errors.\n",
    "- Result display in a card format, including: error title, simple explanation (1-2 sentences), common causes (2-4 bullet points), how to fix (2-5 steps), and short bad/good code examples.\n",
    "- Handling for unknown errors, showing \"No matching error found\" and suggesting keywords like expected, undeclared, segmentation, undefined reference, format.\n",
    "- Error database stored in app.js as an array/JSON, with at least 15 C errors (including the minimum required topics such as expected ';', undeclared variable, implicit declaration, format mismatch, expected ')', expected '}', segmentation fault, array bounds warning, undefined reference, non-void function control, and scanf without '&').\n",
    "- Simple, readable, responsive UI (mobile and desktop) with instant results and clean code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Features\n",
    "These build upon the core features and are categorized by increasing levels of difficulty based on the optional bonuses and high-level upgrade ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Medium Level (Bonus Features)\n",
    "- Copy solution button to easily copy fixes.\n",
    "- Closest matches suggestions for partial error matches.\n",
    "- Favorites functionality using LocalStorage to save common errors.\n",
    "- Filter options for compile vs. runtime errors.\n",
    "- Dark mode toggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hard Level (Advanced Upgrades)\n",
    "- Display top 3 matches with simple scores (e.g., 80%/60%/40%) for non-exact matches.\n",
    "- Error type badges labeling results as Compile Error, Linker Error, or Runtime Error.\n",
    "- Quick Fix button with a short (max 2 steps) fix and a \"More details\" expandable section.\n",
    "- Highlight keywords in the user's input error message (e.g., expected, undeclared, reference, segmentation).\n",
    "- Smart suggestions for unknown errors, offering close options like expected ';', undeclared, or undefined reference.\n",
    "- Two modes: Beginner (simple explanations) and Mentor (deeper technical details).\n",
    "- Mini learning mode with an \"Error of the Day\" featuring a short explanation and fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "- Source code (e.g., hosted on GitHub or similar).\n",
    "- A 1-minute demo video showcasing the application.\n",
    "- PDF presentation of the project.\n",
    "- Example of an explained error message (e.g., a screenshot or exported result).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Specifications\n",
    "- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript only.\n",
    "- **Backend**: None (offline app).\n",
    "- **Data Storage**: Error database as JSON/array in app.js; LocalStorage for favorites or other persistent features.\n",
    "- **Other**: Must be responsive, fast, and work offline; no external dependencies or internet-required features."
